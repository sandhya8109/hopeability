                    <p class="mb-4">When you meet people like Darren, and his sister, Viv, you really begin to understand the full impact of
                         Specialist Disability Accommodation. Viv tells us that since Darren moved into his new home in Innisfail - 
                         one of HopeAbility Care’s SDA projects, his whole demeanour has changed for the better. The fact that his family can 
                         now come and visit him whenever they want, and he’s now living as independently as possible in his very own home has had
                          a hugely positive impact on his life.

                    <p class="mb-4">Del had sustained a spinal cord injury in 2010 so our new home needed to be mobility friendly as well as to incorporate aspects of ageing in place. Fortunately the HopeAbility designs and company ethos not only linked with our needs and requirements but the company went the extra mile to ensure that we were consulted  at every stage of the design and build.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Their attention to detail in sourcing functional, practical and aesthetically pleasing products such as flooring materials, bathroom and tap fittings and cupboard and door handles was faultless. The entry ramp, door widths, handrails and navigable room spaces    were designed and constructed to building standards for disability access.”  </p>
